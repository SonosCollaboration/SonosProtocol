SonosProtocol
=============

This project has been created so that it can work as a gathering place for anyone involved with open source projects that aim to communicate with Sonos devices.

The Sonos communication protocol is not publicly shared. This means that all the information that is available about it in open source projects, has been retrieved with network protocol analyzers. This is a tedious process and therefore this project has been created as a place to share this information, so that not everybody has to get it for themselves.

Workflow and structure
----------------------

The main avenue of work will be the [repository wiki](https://github.com/SonosCollaboration/SonosProtocol/wiki). The repository itself will be used only for data files like raw network protocol dumps or in and output xml files.

Get involved
------------

To get involved simply start adding content to the wiki. Please try and follow the suggested structure with splitting content up into topics and use sub pages for each of these topics.

On the repository side please make a folder for the files for each topic and when you want content added simply make a pull request. Since this is purely supportive information and not source code, content will be pulled rather easily.
