SonosProtocol
=============

This project has been created so that it can work as a gathering place for anyone involved with open source projects that aim to communicate with Sonos® devices.

The Sonos® communication protocol is not publicly shared. This means that all the information that is available about it in open source projects, has been retrieved with network protocol analyzers and from the Sonos® information pages on the devices themselves. This is a tedious process and therefore this project has been created as a place to share this information, so that not everybody has to get it for themselves.

Workflow and structure
----------------------

The main avenue of work will be the
[repository wiki](https://github.com/SonosCollaboration/SonosProtocol/wiki). The
repository itself will be used only for data files like raw network
protocol dumps or in and output xml files.

**No programming language specific implementation examples please.**
  Examples of the content that is sent back and forth, like e.g. the
  XML, is of course very welcome and required both on the wiki and in
  the repository. But in order to keep this documentation project
  programming language and project independent, you are asked to
  please not include any programming language specific example
  implementations. The only exception to this, is the [General
  Structure](https://github.com/SonosCollaboration/SonosProtocol/wiki/Generel-structure),
  wherein we will try to get as many code examples as possible, to get
  people started, and scripts to generate wiki content. Please comply
  with this guide line to avoid potential contributors getting a wrong
  idea of favoritism.

Get involved
------------

To get involved simply start adding content to the wiki. Please try and follow the suggested structure with splitting content up into topics and use sub pages for each of these topics.

On the repository side please make a folder for the files for each topic and when you want content added simply make a pull request. Since this is purely supportive information and not source code, content will be pulled rather easily.
